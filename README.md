# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
A simple ML project used to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.

Project Description:

The project involved several key steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: I obtained movie rating data and movie titles from external sources and merged them to create a comprehensive dataset.

Data Exploration: I explored the dataset to calculate the mean and count of ratings for each movie, providing insights into highly-rated and popular films.

Visualization: Using Seaborn, I created histograms to visualize the distribution of ratings and the number of ratings received by each movie. These visualizations helped us understand user preferences and movie popularity.

Recommendation System: I built a movie recommendation system by analyzing user rating correlations. Specifically, I identified movies similar to "Star Wars (1977)" and "Liar Liar (1997)" based on user ratings, offering personalized movie suggestions.
